## PandaBot
A rather simple, yet multi-purpose bot coded for the Firestone Foundation Project. 

This bot was my first attempt at making a Discord bot in Lua, it uses the Discordia package for Luvit and has very basic commands. As far as code goes the bot is OK, probably not the best source of knowledge though. You can use this for your community if you want, it's fine by me.

## Requirements
PandaBot uses the Discordia package for Luvit, therefore that is a requirement. You will also need to register an application using Discord's Developer site in order to retrieve a token.
