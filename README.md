## PandaBot
PandaBot was my first attempt at making a bot using the Discord API. It's main purpose was to moderate and provide information about one of my projects (Firestone Foundation), the bot was capable of providing basic tools for admins (kick, ban, mute, purge) and fetched information about server playercounts using GET requests. 

## Requirements
PandaBot uses the Discordia package for Luvit, therefore that is a requirement. You will also need to register an application using Discord's Developer site in order to retrieve a token.
