# Panda-Bot
A rather simple, yet multi-purpose bot coded for the rage-gangs community. 

I've coded very basic bots using discord.js before, even tried discord.io but I've decided to give discordia a try since Lua is indeed my main language, I must say it works quite nice. 

The code could be a bit messy, first time working with the library and the discord API in general, you can use it for your own community if you want, as long as I'm credited of course. In order for this to work you need to setup discordia, take a look at: https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia.

Special thanks to Owain Owjo (76561198058562944) for helping me with a lot of the commands.
