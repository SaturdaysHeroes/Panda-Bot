# Panda-Bot
A simple discord bot coded for the rage-gangs community, it has multiple purposes (mainy sending links and adding roles). 

I've coded very basic bots using discord.js before, even tried discord.io but I've decided to give discordia a try since Lua is indeed my main language, I must say it works quite nice. 

The code could be a bit messy, first time working with the library and the discord API in general, you can use it for your own community if you want, as long as I'm credited of course. In order for this to work you need to setup discordia, take a look at: https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia

I would recommend anyone to check out this API if they know Lua, Javascript is a really handy language to learn but if you're not really interested in anything apart from the Discord.js API then I would try this out.
